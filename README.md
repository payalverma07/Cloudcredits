1. Define the Problem
- **Objective**: Clearly state what you aim to achieve through your data
analysis (e.g., understand trends, make predictions).
- **Data Source**: Identify where your data comes from (e.g., CSV file,
database).

2. Data Acquisition
- **Data Collection**: Obtain the dataset you will analyze.
- **Data Understanding**: Explore the structure of the dataset (columns, data
types, initial observations).

3. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Handle Missing Data**: Decide how to deal with missing values (e.g.,
imputation, deletion).
- **Data Transformation**: Convert data types if necessary (e.g., dates to datetime
objects).
- **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant columns/features for analysis.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute basic statistics (mean, median, mode, range,
etc.).
- **Data Visualization**: Create plots (histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to
understand distributions and relationships between variables.
- **Identify Patterns**: Look for trends, anomalies, or patterns in the data.

5. Basic Statistical Analysis
- **Correlation Analysis**: Measure relationships between variables.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: If applicable, conduct basic statistical tests to validate
assumptions.
